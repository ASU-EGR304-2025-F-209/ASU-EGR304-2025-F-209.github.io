| "Peace of mind for a very small price. I'm impressed by the volume or the alarms from such a small device. I can hear it from anywhere in my home. I feel the noise will deter entry by itself, but it's settling to know I'll be aware of any entry or attempts. When my small grandchildren visit me, I'll know if they try to exit as well. The sensor very well-designed. I've had no false alarms or failures to sound as intended to date. Installation was a breeze, and the adhesive is quite strong." | 1.  The sensor provides a sense of safety (explicit)                              |
| "Very well made, easy to use. They are awesome for anythine. But I bought them to get my son back for always scaryin me i put 1 ok the refrigerator, pantry, at to top of his closer and going it his bath room. They are so load on the sire part. Thats what I used but it also has a chime you can set also They are awesome and I finally got him back. Worth every penney. no maater what its for... hahaha" | 2.  The sensor is easy to install (explicit) |
| "Boy this will scare the heck out of anyone (including yourself!!) Noone trying to open your window will stick around after it goes off, are you kidding-all you will see are the bottom of their sneakers running as fast as they can Lol. I also bring one with me when I go for walks-you can just put it in your hand or pocket if you feel the need for safety. You won't see anyone for miles after this goes off!!" | 3.  The sensor is loud enough to hear anywhere in a home (explicit)                               |

| "Unsafe- Not real security alarms These shut off the alarm as soon as door/window is closed. So if someone opens the door/window and your in the shower or tv is high you likely will miss it if intruder shuts door/window right away. It's not like a smoke alarm that keeps alarming. Pretty pathetic if the intruder can shut it down that fast, so NOT a safety or security device" | 1.  The sensor should require a security shut-off code. (latent)                       |
| "I NOT HAVE BOUGHT IF I KNEW IF NOT SET UP RIGHT YOU COULD GO DEAF FROM THE BEEPING SOUND IT MAKE WHEN DOOR OR WINDOW IS OPEN /AND THE SAD THING IT SAYS IT ON THE INSIDE OF PACKAGE WHEN YOU ARE READING THE DIRECTIONS. WOULD NOT HAVE BOUGHT IF I SAW ON OUT SIDE OF PACKAGE ." | 2.  The sensor should have volume control (latent) |
| "Make sure you have the right kind of door. It does not fit my door the woodwork must be flush or it will not work." | 3.  The sensor should clearly mark what surface is needed for mounting (explicit)           |

| "Really like this keypad. The operating instruction were vague, but we figured them out. Recommend to press the %23 sign to light up the keypad, then enter code then %23. Keypad will say, "Door unlocked." To lock the door, press the %23 sign for 3 seconds. It will say, "Door locked." 3 wrong entries will lock you out for 3 mins.

| "I picked up the Ring Alarm Contact Sensor for one of my entry doors and was really impressed with how easy the whole process was. Setup was super simple, basically just pulled it out of the box, followed the app instructions, and it connected without any issues. What I really liked is that it already had adhesive tape applied, so I didn’t even need to dig out tools or screws. I just peeled the backing off and stuck it directly to the door and frame. Took maybe two minutes total. It’s been working perfectly since, alerting me right away whenever the door opens. It’s a solid little sensor and blends in nicely without being too noticeable."| 1.   Easy to Set Up and Works Great(explicit)|
|"I purchased these sensors to add to my security system. Super easy to connect to base station and configure. A bit challenging to mount on an inswing recessed door. I ended up chiseling a small hole in the door jamb to insert the magnet and mounted the sensor portion to the door. For installation on windows, I was able to mount the 2 pieces and right angles to each other and still have reliable pickup/dropout of the contact."|2.Installation more forgiving than expected(explicit)|
| "I had new Windows installed and was using previous wired contacts with my ring alarm. Needed to install new ring wireless contacts and they work perfectly. Very easy to set-up but I do wish there was a smaller version available." | 3. Best option for wireless(explicit)|

| "We are fans of ring but this was not a good experience. Bought the product and was away on work travel for a month. Got back to install, and this simple sensor did not work but it was 1 day after the 30 day purchase so had to call Ring support who made me spent a lot of time i did not have to then tell me it was defective and they would send a new one that will not get here before i leave on another month long project and on top of that i have to take the old sensor to the UPS store - more time that I did not have. This is not what we expect from Amazon owned Ring." | 1.Wants the sensor to work without requiring the full base station. (explicit)|
| "Why did you pick this product vs others?: Don't be fooled and think you can buy just this and it will connect to your phone.  Apparently you NEED TO BUY THE WHOLE BASE STATION for this thing to even connect to the app.  What a f***ing disappointment.  DO BETTER Ring.  Instant return and will be buying a cheap Chinese counterpart that at least doesn't force me to buy the whole $100 base station as well." | 2.  Wants the system to maintain connectivity during power/internet outages. (explicit)|
|  "I've been a loyal Ring customer for years. One of the things that attracted me to Ring in the first place was its cellular backup feature. After ensuring that my area had coverage, I purchased the base station and many sensors. Amid the recent southern California wildfires, my power went out and so did my internet. Unfortunately, my Ring base station failed to establish a cellular connection. This was highly regrettable, because a cellular connection was what I needed most during the disaster and threats of looting. After hours of troubleshooting with Ring support, I was simply told that I was out of luck - that the cellular connection provided by ATT must have spontaneously changed, and there was nothing I nor they could do. So, despite investing hundreds of dollars in Ring and being a loyal customer for years, I was simply told "good luck."I would not recommend Ring hardware or services."  | 3.Wants timely and helpful assistance when products fail.(explicit) |

| "I was worried when I saw the owner’s manual of this lock because it is thick! There are templates even! But I watched a few videos (thank God for YouTube) and it seemed pretty straightforward so I took a deep breath and gave it a go. The installation really only took about ten minutes! And the lock works like a charm! I’m still exploring the different features, but so far I’m liking it a lot. I bought this lock so that when I travel I can give the house sitter a temporary code and I can know who’s coming and going and whether the door is locked." | 1.  The device instructions are easy to follow. (explicit) |
| This Yale Assure Lock 2 Keypad with Wi-Fi in Satin Nickel is a great Lock. It is made of very high quality materials, very sturdy and well put together. I was able to install the entire lock in under 10 minutes and setting up the app and getting it connected was a breeze.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | 2.  The device is easy to setup. (explicit)                |
| The added bonus for me is that there’s an app I can have full control of at any time, through my phone or watch. My husband and I are feel far more secure and safe in comparison to using the basic setup we had before. Installation was very easy. Everything was packaged very well. The instructions were very helpful and detailed. The only con I can list is that I didn’t think to purchase this myself sooner.                                                                                                                                                  | 3.

| "Invested in 28 Yale Assure 2 locks for enhanced security, but severe battery drain issues across all units have been a colossal letdown. Frequent replacements, lack of low-battery warnings, and unexpected lockouts make these locks a costly and frustrating investment. Managing 28 unreliable units turns promised convenience into a significant headache. Considering alternatives is highly recommended. Customer service has been very unhelpful in getting this resolved." | 1.  The device is able to last multiple uses across a year. (explicit) |
| Called customer service. Did some troubleshooting and the associate verified based on the information available from wi-fi the lock was not working. Wouldn’t provide replacement without proof of purchase, which I do not have. Going to need to replace the entire lock.                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 2.

| Normal keypad lock with wifi. Unable to connect to nest or apple home apps. The Yale lock app is little to be desired assume they want you to use a 3rd party app to manage the lock.
