| "Really like this keypad. The operating instruction were vague, but we figured them out. Recommend to press the %23 sign to light up the keypad, then enter code then %23. Keypad will say, "Door unlocked." To lock the door, press the %23 sign for 3 seconds. It will say, "Door locked." 3 wrong entries will lock you out for 3 mins.
