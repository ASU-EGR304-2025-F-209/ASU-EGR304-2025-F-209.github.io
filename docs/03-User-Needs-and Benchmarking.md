| "Really like this keypad. The operating instruction were vague, but we figured them out. Recommend to press the %23 sign to light up the keypad, then enter code then %23. Keypad will say, "Door unlocked." To lock the door, press the %23 sign for 3 seconds. It will say, "Door locked." 3 wrong entries will lock you out for 3 mins. The FOB works well, but the fingerprint works sometimes. The app is really good, and it's free, but you can pay for extra features. Awesome keypad for the price." | 1.

| "I picked up the Ring Alarm Contact Sensor for one of my entry doors and was really impressed with how easy the whole process was. Setup was super simple, basically just pulled it out of the box, followed the app instructions, and it connected without any issues.

What I really liked is that it already had adhesive tape applied, so I didn’t even need to dig out tools or screws. I just peeled the backing off and stuck it directly to the door and frame. Took maybe two minutes total.

It’s been working perfectly since, alerting me right away whenever the door opens. It’s a solid little sensor and blends in nicely without being too noticeable." | 1.   Easy to Set Up and Works Great!

Super easy to connect to base station and configure. A bit challenging to mount on an inswing recessed door. I ended up chiseling a small hole in the door jamb to insert the magnet and mounted the sensor portion to the door. For installation on windows, I was able to mount the 2 pieces and right angles to each other and still have reliable pickup/dropout of the contact."         | 2.

| "We are fans of ring but this was not a good experience. Bought the product and was away on work travel for a month. Got back to install, and this simple sensor did not work but it was 1 day after the 30 day purchase so had to call Ring support who made me spent a lot of time i did not have to then tell me it was defective and they would send a new one that will not get here before i leave on another month long project and on top of that i have to take the old sensor to the UPS store - more time that I did not have. This is not what we expect from Amazon owned Ring." | 1.  
 stars Defective and Out of Warranty by 1 Day - Waste of Time                       |
| "Why did you pick this product vs others?:
Don't be fooled and think you can buy just this and it will connect to your phone.  Apparently you NEED TO BUY THE WHOLE BASE STATION for this thing to even connect to the app.  What a f***ing disappointment.  DO BETTER Ring.  Instant return and will be buying a cheap Chinese counterpart that at least doesn't force me to buy the whole $100 base station as well." | 2.  DOES NOT WORK UNLESS YOU BUY ENTIRE BASE STATION !!!!! |
|   "I've been a loyal Ring customer for years. One of the things that attracted me to Ring in the first place was its cellular backup feature. After ensuring that my area had coverage, I purchased the base station and many sensors. Amid the recent southern California wildfires, my power went out and so did my internet. Unfortunately, my Ring base station failed to establish a cellular connection. This was highly regrettable, because a cellular connection was what I needed most during the disaster and threats of looting. After hours of troubleshooting with Ring support, I was simply told that I was out of luck - that the cellular connection provided by ATT must have spontaneously changed, and there was nothing I nor they could do. So, despite investing hundreds of dollars in Ring and being a loyal customer for years, I was simply told "good luck."

I would not recommend Ring hardware or services."  | 3.  Unreliable Ring Service - Avoid           |
