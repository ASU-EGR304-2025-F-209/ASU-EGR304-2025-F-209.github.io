## Team Introduction

>  Team 209 is a collaborative engineering group dedicated to pushing the boundaries of human communication through innovative technology. We aim to design and build an implantable device that enables users to  learn, translate, and communicate in new languages by integrating a real-time language processing and speaking system.This device removes barriers of language, accelerates learning, and allows instant multilingual communication.<br> 
> Through this project, we seek not only to create a functional and reliable prototype but also to develop as a cohesive team, applying engineering practices and innovative thinking, to deliver a product with real-world impact.
