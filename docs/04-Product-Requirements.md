## Project Objective

This project aims to investigate and develop smart adaptive technologies, an improved user experience, better fit, improved product design, and product customization options for the next-generation of home door sensors. The target is to create a working prototype by the end of 2025. We aim to create a product that is better than existing products by focusing on implementing user feedback.

Matthew also likes to travel. His new smart door sensors allow him to know whenever a door is open by alerting him on his phone. 

**User Story #2: Alice**
Alice is a 27-year-old mother of three boys. She is looking for a device to monitor when her children open the door and leave the house while with the door open. This smart door sensor assists her by alerting when the door has been left open for a while, and when the door is used by her children. This device provides ease for the mother from having to check up on the door whenever it is used.
