## Project Objective

This project aims to investigate and develop smart adaptive technologies, an improved user experience, better fit, improved product design, and product customization options for the next-generation of home door sensors. The target is to create a working prototype by the end of 2025. We aim to create a product that is better than existing products by focusing on implementing user feedback.

## Stakeholders

- **Target group** Home owners or apartment renters. They fit the use-case of the product. The main benefits are security and energy savings.
- **Target purchaser** Target group profile with special attention to Full Nest I and Full Nest II mothers.
- **Customer service** Prefers easy-to-repair, easy-to-fix complaints, and clear instructions.
- **Marketing & Sales division** Looks for unique selling points around retail stores and online marketplaces.
- **Retailers** Prefer products that can withstand a wide range of storage conditions including variations in temperature, vibration, humidity, and atmospheric pressure, and have a strong and compact, theft, and vandalism-proof packaging.


## Use Cases

**User Story #1: Matthew**
Matthew is a 33-year-old new homeowner. He is looking for something to provide some extra security to his home. His new smart door sensor allows him to sleep easy knowing it will alert him to any theives breaking in at night. 

Matthew also likes to travel. His new smart door sensors allow him to know whenever a door is open by alerting him on his phone. 

## Aspects

The new product design will be based on that of the AirPods with improvements based on the following requirements. The **P1 - P10** is the "code" to indicate the priority of the requirement, from low to high.

1. **Producr Design**
   * 1.1 The product shall be visually easy to distinguish from existing AirPods as well as main competitors Sony WF-1000XM3, Jabra Elite, Amazon Echo Buds, Samsung Galaxy Buds, and Bose SoundSport Free, and Urbanista Stockholm. (P10)
   * 1.1 The product shall be easy to recognize as an Apple product without needing a logo on its exterior. (P10)
   * 1.2. The product shall avoid styling elements from our Powerbeats over-ear wireless headphones since those address a different market segment. (P8)
  
1. **Functionality**
      * 2.1 The product shall incorporate one or more optical proximity sensors to detect the user wearing it. (P10)
      * 2.2 The product shall offer a dual microphone in each earbud. (P10)

## Requirement Criteria Specifications

* 1.1.1 - Regulate system power from 9 volts to 5 volts
* 1.1.2 - Provide over-amperage project to not exceed 1.5 amps.

## Open Questions

* Can we move towards a recyclable and repairable product, for example, with ZIF connectors and glue-free assembly?
* Can we improve on failing or self-igniting batteries?
