### Main Method for Group Communication

Based on the information provided on in the "Team Member Communication Modes," the group primary method of communication is text message. A discord call will be used if there is a need to collaborate simultaneously and a meet-up is not possible.
 
## Communication Procedures

1. All communication will start over text message. A text notification will be sent to the teams group chat is a member feels the need for further action on a project.
2. Instructor correspondence will be relaid to the team by the team leader. The leader will be responsible for making sure the team is aware of any update to the requirements set for the projects.

## Meeting Coordination

1. When a meeting is set over text, every team member is expected to make a personal reminder of the meeting time.
1. Any change to the meeting time or location should only be done through call to ensure every member is aware and on-board with the idea.
1. The default format of the meetings will be over discord. Any need to meet-up should be communicated over the initial text message, and a required subsequent call.
1. A meeting must contain a minimum of three available members of the team, should it be impossible to find a time that works for all 4.

## Conflict Recognition & Resolution

1. All conflicts will first be addressed among team members.
2. In cases of escalation, the team leader is to have the final say on any form of meditation or compromise.
3. In cases where conflict is based on problems beyond student resolution, the team leader (or involved party) is to consult and make the teacher aware of the situation.
4. If the team leader enforces a compromise or arbitration in which the involved party is displeased with, the member can bring it up to the teacher to approve of the solution enforced.
