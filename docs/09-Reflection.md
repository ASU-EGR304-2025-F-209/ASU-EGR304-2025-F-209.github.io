## Lessons Learned
The top 10 most important things learned from working on this project were the following: 

* Do the assignments early as they will take more time than you think.
* Check your schematic multiple times before designing the PCB.
* Check your footprints, they might not fit on the actual PCB.
* Link your grounds between teamates or else projects will act weird.
* Check the ribbon cable is correct on the PCB design, that the traces don't go to the wrong wire.
* It can be hard to troubleshoot the code, take it slow as it can get frustrating when it does not work.
* When you wire your project make sure that everything is connected as it should be before you plug in your power.
* Communicate better with each other as it can be frustrating when nobody responds to your message.
* Make sure you wire your voltage regulator correctly, or else it can get very hot and output too much power.
* Make sure you ground VOFF as its the only way for your microcontroller to recieve outside power.


## Recommendations for future students
* Ask for help from the professor early and often
* Get assignments done early
* Make sure the footprints match the physical size of components
* Understand how your components work before you purchase them
* Designing circuits is hard so leave time in your schedule to redo everything
