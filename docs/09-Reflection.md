## Lessons Learned
The top 10 most important things learned from working on this project were the following: 

* Do the assignments early as they will take more time than you think
* Check your schematic multiple times before designing the PCB
* Check your footprints, they might not fit on the actual PCB
* Link your grounds between teamates or else projects will act weird
* Check the ribbon cable is correct on the PCB design, that the traces don't go to the wrong wire
* 
* 
* 
* 
* 


## Recommendations for future students
* Ask for help from the professor early and often
* Get assignments done early
* Make sure the footprints match the physical size of components
* Understand how your components work before you purchase them
* Designing circuits is hard so leave time in your schedule to redo everything
