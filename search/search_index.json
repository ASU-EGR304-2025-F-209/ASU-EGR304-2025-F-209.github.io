The first meeting was dedicated to taking product needs and coming up with features that filled those needs. All of our team members showed up at the ASU Polytechnic library to discuss the features for each need. We started off with brainstorming ideas, trying to come up with a feature that could improve upon each need stated in the previous assignment. We collectively typed into a Google document, filling in the table with feature ideas as we went along. We got stumped along the way and communicated through the problems in trying to think of solutions that could solve the needs of the consumers. We got most of the table done and decided to call it a day.</p> <p>Our team\u2019s second session was also held in the ASU Polytechnic library, where we started off by finishing the table from the first session. It did not take too long, and soon the table had been completed. We then started to come up with grouping ideas to group each feature into separate categories that made more sense. Starting with Power and Battery Management. This made sense as a group because there were a lot of features that had to deal with batteries and saving power. We then went on to Mounting and stability as our second group. Our third group was Durability and longevity of the device. Our fourth group was for Simplicity and installing the device. Our fifth group was for user interface and feedback. Our sixth group was for security and system integration. Our seventh group was for connectivity and independence. Finally, our eighth and last group was for accuracy. We were satisfied with our 8 different groups for the features then started to decide which features would go into which group. After that we worked on ranking the features in each group. Starting with the first group, we decided that a rechargeable battery seemed like the best idea for the power group, then solar panel, as it also seemed like a really good idea. We continued on and ranked all of the features of each group. Some of them we started with the best ideas and some of them we decided which were the worst first. For example, updates, while it seems like a good concept idea it does not really help our device all that much with longevity. </p> <p>Our team\u2019s third meeting was also held in the library, where we started by thinking of different concept ideas that could work as a product using our ranked features. We came up with 3 different concepts using a few features because there were a lot. Then Bryce drew the concept ideas, trying to incorporate the features as best as he could. Finally finished with the drawings, he added them to the assignment along with the concept ideas and the features that were listed in the drawings.</p> <p>We drew our list of requirements from the Team - Design Ideation assignment which had all the information we needed. We used Google Docs to collect our ideas together as it updated instantly and we all typed into it adding onto each other.
