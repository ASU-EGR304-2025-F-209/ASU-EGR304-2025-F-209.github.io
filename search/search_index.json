This was highly regrettable, because a cellular connection was what I needed most during the disaster and threats of looting. After hours of troubleshooting with Ring support, I was simply told that I was out of luck - that the cellular connection provided by ATT must have spontaneously changed, and there was nothing I nor they could do.

The first meeting was dedicated to taking product needs and coming up with features that filled those needs. All of our team members showed up at the ASU Polytechnic library to discuss the features for each need. We started off with brainstorming ideas, trying to come up with a feature that could improve upon each need stated in the previous assignment. We collectively typed into a Google document, filling in the table with feature ideas as we went along. We got stumped along the way and communicated through the problems in trying to think of solutions that could solve the needs of the consumers. We got most of the table done and decided to call it a day.</p> <p>Our team\u2019s second session was also held in the ASU Polytechnic library, where we started off by finishing the table from the first session. It did not take too long, and soon the table had been completed. We then started to come up with grouping ideas to group each feature into separate categories that made more sense. Starting with Power and Battery Management. This made sense as a group because there were a lot of features that had to deal with batteries and saving power. We then went on to Mounting and stability as our second group. Our third group was Durability and longevity of the device. Our fourth group was for Simplicity and installing the device. Our fifth group was for user interface and feedback. Our sixth group was for security and system integration. Our seventh group was for connectivity and independence. Finally, our eighth and last group was for accuracy. We were satisfied with our 8 different groups for the features then started to decide which features would go into which group. After that we worked on ranking the features in each group. Starting with the first group, we decided that a rechargeable battery seemed like the best idea for the power group, then solar panel, as it also seemed like a really good idea. We continued on and ranked all of the features of each group. Some of them we started with the best ideas and some of them we decided which were the worst first. For example, updates, while it seems like a good concept idea it does not really help our device all that much with longevity. </p> <p>Our team\u2019s third meeting was also held in the library, where we started by thinking of different concept ideas that could work as a product using our ranked features. We came up with 3 different concepts using a few features because there were a lot. Then Bryce drew the concept ideas, trying to incorporate the features as best as he could. Finally finished with the drawings, he added them to the assignment along with the concept ideas and the features that were listed in the drawings.</p> <p>We drew our list of requirements from the Team - Design Ideation assignment which had all the information we needed. We used Google Docs to collect our ideas together as it updated instantly and we all typed into it adding onto each other. We also used google to generate ideas for when we got stuck and could not think of anything else.</p> <p> Figure 01 User Needs</p> <p> Figure 02 Sorted User Needs</p> <p> Figure 03 Ranked User Needs</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/","title":"Team Block Diagram","text":""},{"location":"06-team-block-diagram/#introduction","title":"Introduction","text":"<p>Team 209 Smart Door Sensor System block diagram.

This makes it easier to isolate issues, upgrade individual components, and perform testing without affecting the entire design. It also makes logic processing and output of the entire system faster.</p> <p>Improved Diagnostics &amp; LED Feedback  Include multiple debugging LEDs throughout the system to represent power status, state, sensor activity, communication status, and fault indicators. These LEDs provide instant visual confirmation of each subsystem\u2019s behavior, greatly simplifying testing and troubleshooting.</p> <p>Better Power Management  Create three central rails with a voltage regulator from 12v to 9v to 5v. This helps reduce the amount of cables needed to be plugged into the entire system, reduces heat generated by the system and reduces the total cost of the system.</p> <p>Software V2.0</p> <p>State Machine Architecture  The current system uses separate state machines that can become unsynchronized. Version 2.0 should use a centralized hierarchical state machine to coordinate all subsystems under one control. This prevents conflicting behaviors, ensures transitions only occur when conditions are valid, and allows state history tracking for easier debugging and recovery.</p> <p>Input Debounce and Validation  The fingerpad input should include software debouncing through delays to prevent false triggers from switch noise. Adding input timeouts to clear incomplete password entries, max-length limits and detection of impossible input sequences could improve security and reliability.</p> <p>Configurable Alarm Timer  Instead of a fixed delay, or a toggle that can be forgotten, Version 2.0 can allow user-configurable alarm timers for different conditions. A simple \u201csnooze\u201d feature to temporarily extends the timer during open scenarios could greatly improve user feedback.</p> <p>Motor Control Refinement  The current motor logic is simple. Adding limit switches or encoders provides position feedback instead of assuming success. Current sensing could detects jams or obstructions. Soft-start/soft-stop PWM control can reduces stress and noise, and a maximum run-time would prevents motor damage during faults.</p>"},{"location":"07-Team-Software-Design/#conclusions","title":"Conclusions","text":"<p>The decision process of the software sequence follows the same pattern as when making the block diagram.
